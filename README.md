Welcome to this Python project template!

This template is designed to help you get started with your Python scientific project. It includes a directory structure, files, and configurations that will help you get up and running quickly.

The `project_name` directory is where your project's code will live. The `scripts`, `notebooks`, and `data` directories are where you'll store your project's Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and data files, respectively. The `outputs` directory is where your project's output files will be stored (e.g., results, figures...). Finally, the report directory contains a LaTeX template for your project's report.

The `README.md` file contains this information and is intended to help you understand and use the template.

The `LICENSE` file contains the license for this template.

The `.gitignore` file tells git which files to ignore when you're using version control.

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of Python libraries that your project depends on.
